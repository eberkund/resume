Hi Rita,

My friend Mahta Moattari referred me to this job because she thought I would be a good fit for the role. I graduated from Ryerson University last spring with a B.Eng. in computer engineering and I am currently teaching computer science at a private high school.

My strongest language is Java because most of the courses I took in school were taught in it and I’ve done a few large projects in it outside of school. Most recently I worked on a athletic performance tracker at a Hackathon. The portion that was written in Java collected sensor data, performed calculations, and displayed a coloured graph of the results.

I have about 5 years of freelance experience designing websites and I am very strong with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (mainly jQuery but also pure JS and I recently began working with Angular). As well as some backend development in PHP, Java and SQL. Including the final culminating project during my last year in school which was done with SQL and PHP and some exposure to Zend Framework (MVC). I’m very familiar with the command line tools and the most commonly used preprocessor tools like SASS, Node Package Manager, and Grunt. 

I like that the job description encompasses a broad range of responsibilities because being a part of the full scope of the project is what I always strive to achieve. Thanks for taking the time to read over my application, I am looking forward to hearing back from you so that we can talk about my qualifications in more detail.
