To the Genesys recruiting team,

I am a computer engineering graduate from Ryerson. I spoke with some Genesys representatives at the recent new grad job fair on May 4\textsuperscript{th} about my suitability for the *Front End Developer* and *Programmer Analyst -- Java* positions.

Along with my education, I have done freelance web design work for the past 5 years. I have worked with lots of different web software which includes designing pages using HTML and CSS from scratch and integrating with different templating languages. Working on production websites has made me very aware of cross-browser compatibility issues and optimizing website performance using tools like Google PageSpeed.

For my final engineering design project I created a medical device for tracking patients in an extended care facility where I wrote code to generate HTTP requests from scratch so that the microcontroller could communicate through our RESTful API.

I also have very strong object oriented programming skills and I am very quick to pick up new languages and frameworks. I recently worked on a swarm robotics project for mapping the layout of a room. I wrote the backend of the system using Java to receive data from the robots and combine it, so that it could be displayed visually.

I enjoy learning new skills and interacting productively with people from diverse backgrounds. I greatly appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to meeting with you to discuss my suitability.
